# Dev Fit Gym Logistical Tracker

## Description

This is a gym tracker app which allows clients to create accounts, log in with existing accounts, see trainer information, and view and join classes. It also allows trainers to add or remove classes and view class rosters. Managers on this app are able to view a list of trainers employed by the gym, pull up an individual trainer's information, terminate a trainer's employment by removing that trainer from the database, or hire a new trainer by adding his/her information into the database. A manager can also view all classes available at the gym for the week, view class rosters, and add/remove members from class rosters.
